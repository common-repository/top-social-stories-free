Collects social data and shows you which posts are most popular based on post shares across popular social networks. With widget. Tracks data from...

== Description ==

This plugin collects social data (without slowing down your site!) and shows you which of your posts and authors are most popular based on how many times each post has been shared on various social networks.

Top Social Stories are your best posts, the most shared on social networks. This plugin gives you a social metrics tool to analyze and discover your most viral posts: you can see statistics about how many Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin and Vkontakte interactions you have every day for each post, each author and globally for all your site. When you install it wait some days to let the plugin collect data from social networks and then it will build ranks for authors and posts.

If you are you using social share buttons on your site, than you need this plugin to save data and monitor social interactions!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long does it take to collect data? =

It depends on the traffic of your site and the "ajax delay calls parameter", if you have a lot of traffic and put the "ajax delay calls parameter" to 5-10 seconds, it will take many data in a few hours. After install you should wait a few days to get a lot of data, but you can reload the analytics page every time you want to see changes in collected data.

= Does it slow down my site? =

No, data are collected asyncronously with javascript, after some seconds (this is the "ajax delay calls parameter") that the page is loaded.

= Can I show shares counters in my theme? =

Yes you can activate the export feature to save counters on custom fields for each post (you will find 'facebook_shares', 'twitter_shares' fields... one for each social network). Then you have to use the standard custom fields function to extract data.
